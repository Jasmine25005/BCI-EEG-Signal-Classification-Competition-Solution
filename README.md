This repository contains the complete solution for the **MTCAIC3 Kaggle competition**, focusing on the classification of EEG brain signals for two distinct Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) tasks: **Motor Imagery (MI)** and **Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)**.

## üó∫Ô∏è Overall Strategy

The MI and SSVEP tasks require different signal processing techniques. This solution implements two independent, specialized pipelines to maximize performance for each task:

* **Motor Imagery (MI) Pipeline:**
    > **Bandpass Filter ‚Üí Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) ‚Üí Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).**

* **SSVEP Pipeline:**
    > **Bandpass Filter ‚Üí Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).**

A `StratifiedGroupKFold` cross-validation strategy was used to ensure the models generalize well across different subjects.

## üî¨ Methodology Highlights

### Signal Preprocessing
A key first step was applying a **bandpass filter** to the raw EEG data to isolate relevant neural frequencies and remove noise. Different frequency bands were used for each task to align with their unique neural signatures.

### Classification Models
* **For Motor Imagery (MI):** We used **Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)**, a powerful algorithm for EEG feature extraction, combined with a **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** classifier.
* **For SSVEP:** We used **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**, the state-of-the-art method which classifies signals by finding the highest correlation with reference frequencies.
